# Clustering-HelpNGO
Help NGO is a Non Profit Organization - looking to help countries with direst need in providing Financial Aid. They want to help the top ten countries with lowest gdp and income and a high mortality rate to filter out from a list of 167 countries. We come in to help the NGO to shortlist these countries by building a Model using K-Means Clustering.
